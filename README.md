# V-Slice Mod Manager/V-Slice MM

* A mod manager for FNF v0.3x

* Yes I know way better mod managers exist but I wanted to do my own take on it

# How to use

* Copy all of the files to your V-Slice directory (NOT THE MODS FOLDER), if it asks you to overwrite anything DO NOT DO IT.

* Use the arrow keys to scroll through mods

# Creds

* Funkin' Crew Inc - Friday Night Funkin'

* Kawai Sprite - The banger known as "Gay".

* TyDotCS - V-Slice MM
